# 🏭 CoreFoundry

**CoreFoundry** is a modular SaaS platform with interactive, video game-style visualization inspired by *Satisfactory*, where each module is a visual station that can be activated, connected, and send data in real time, all through an immersive and personalized interface for each client.

## 🎮 Main Concept

> Imagine a SaaS where each module (Inventory, Sales, Reports) looks like a machine in an operational base. You can connect them, configure them visually, and see animated data flows traveling between them.

Each client can:
- 🔧 Activate or deactivate modules from a visual store
- 🧠 Connect them logically and graphically (like data cables!)
- 🌐 See how data "travels" from module to module with animations
- ⚙️ Configure flows without code, directly from a visual panel
